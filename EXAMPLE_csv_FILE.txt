1,"Ask questions that arise from careful observation of phenomena, models, or unexpected results, to clarify and/or seek additional information.","This lesson supports students in asking questions that can be used to investigate a phenomenon. Students first observe the mirror-window in the context of the video and then investigate it further using a scale model (i.e., box model) that represents important parts of the system in the video. They craft questions about the phenomenon while focusing on different parts and interactions within the system that they believe are important for explaining the phenomenon. Students group their questions into clusters and brainstorm different kinds of investigations to conduct to answer their questions."
1,Develop and/or use a model to predict and/or describe phenomena.,"Students develop models to represent what they think is happening as parts of the system interact, leading to the phenomenon. They use a scale model that represents important components of the system in the video to provide additional 
observations of the phenomenon and test their ideas for explaining those observations. They also develop diagrammatic models to represent their thinking about the phenomenon. In doing so, students learn that models can be used to describe and explain a phenomenon."
2,"Ask questions that can be investigated within the scope of the classroom, outdoor environment, and museums and other public facilities with available resources and, when appropriate, frame a hypothesis based on observations and scientific principles.","On day 1, students return to the DQB/consensus model and discuss which questions they can investigate in the classroom about the effects of changing the light in the box model. They frame a hypothesis for what they think will happen, based on observations from Lesson 1, and then investigate their questions by swapping the light to the other side of the model."
2,Develop or modify a model—based on evidence—to match what happens if a variable or component of a system is changed.,"On day 2, students modify a model, based on evidence, to match what happens if a variable or component of a system (i.e., light) is changed. They consider the DQB/consensus model from Lesson 1 and then model what they think is happening when they test different lighting scenarios."
3,"Ask questions to determine relationships between independent and dependent variables and 
relationships in models.","In this lesson, students develop a testable question to determine how the materials that make up a one way mirror, glass, and a regular mirror (independent 
variable) influence the amount of light that transmits through and reflects off (dependent variable) an object. They then use that question to plan an investigation, including the independent variable, dependent variable, and constants. After collecting and analyzing class data, students work together to create a consensus model that describes what is happening when light shines on each material."

3,"Develop and/or use a model to generate data to test ideas about phenomena in natural or designed systems, including those representing inputs and outputs, and those at unobservable scales.","Students conduct two investigations in this lesson. In the first investigation, they observe what happens when light shines on a one-way mirror, glass, and a regular mirror. They observe that light reflects off all three materials but only two materials transmit light. They develop an initial model to describe what they observed, which motivates the need to measure the amount of light that transmits through and reflects off each material. Students develop an experimental question, plan a second investigation, and use light meters to measure the amount of light reflected and transmitted by the three materials. After analyzing class data, students revise the consensus model to more accurately describe what happens when light shines on each material."
4,Develop a model to describe unobservable mechanisms.,"Students investigate microscale structures of a one way mirror. These microscale structures cause light to transmit and reflect differently from regular glass and mirrors. Students use the structures of a one way mirror to generate ideas about unobservable mechanisms that help to explain observations they have made of materials, both qualitatively and quantitatively."
5,"Develop and/or revise a model to show the relationships among variables, including those that are not observable but predict observable 
phenomena.","Students revise a model to explain how light’s interactions with the music student and the adults, as well as how light’s interactions with the one-way mirror material, which reflects and transmits about the same amount of the light, cause both the student and the adults to see the student. Students develop unobservable mechanisms that describe how light interacts with microscale structures within the one-way mirror to account for the observable phenomenon, in which the one-way mirror acts like a mirror on the light side and a window on the dark side."
6,"Ask questions to clarify and/or refine a model, an explanation, or an engineering problem.","In this lesson, students ask questions to help them clarify and refine their model. In the previous lesson, students realized their model was incomplete for explaining the phenomenon. This prompted additional investigation to figure out how light interacts with the eye. As students delve into how the eye works, they encounter new information about the structures of the eye and how those structures interact with light to change its direction. This raises new questions. They investigate how the convex lens of a magnifying glass changes the direction of (refracts) light. Then, they compare what they observe to how the lens of the eye refracts light to focus it onto the retina at the back of the eye."
6,Develop a model to describe unobservable mechanisms.,"After students investigate how light interacts with the structures of the eye, they leverage personal experiences to help them describe and model how the brain processes signals to tell us what we “see” when multiple inputs of light are detected by the eye. This helps students account for unobservable mechanisms that can explain why the music student does not see the adults despite light reflecting off the adults and entering the student’s eyes."

7,"Construct an explanation using models or 
representations.","Students construct an explanation for the one-way mirror phenomenon using their models from Lessons 5 and 6 and supported by science ideas developed and evidence gathered throughout the unit. Students explain different aspects of the one way mirror phenomenon, first as a whole class and then individually."
7,"Respectfully provide and receive critiques about one’s explanations, procedures, models, and questions by citing relevant evidence and posing and responding to questions that elicit pertinent elaboration and detail.","During peer feedback, students respectfully provide critiques about each other’s explanations, pointing out places where their peers have included how and why accounts supported by evidence and posting questions and offering suggestions for how to improve the explanation. After peer feedback, students receive critiques about their explanations and respond to questions by adding more 
elaboration and detail."
8,Develop and/or use a model to predict and/or describe phenomena.,"On day 1 students deepen their understanding of their model for explaining the one-way mirror phenomenon with a focus on the idea that light differential between the two sides of the system strengthens or weakens the phenomenon. They use this idea as they reconsider related phenomena and determine which phenomena may be explained using the light differential idea. They notice that they can observe a one-way mirror effect in situations that do not involve one-way mirror material, such as glass or plastic, but do involve a light differential. This prompts students to use their model to describe how changing a part of the system (swapping the one-way mirror for regular glass) can lead to similar outcomes as the one-way mirror phenomenon. They can support their initial explanations using the science ideas and model they have already developed as well as some new evidence they collect by investigating glass in their box models."
8,"Apply scientific ideas, principles, and/or evidence to construct, revise and/or use an explanation for real world phenomena, examples, or events.","On day 2, students apply science ideas, their model, and the evidence they collected to construct an explanation for real-world phenomena in which glass acts similar to a one-way mirror in certain light conditions. They co-construct their explanations in a scaffolded way during a class Consensus Discussion and then individually on an assessment. They must draw upon science ideas related to light reflecting off and transmitting through materials and objects, as well as science ideas related to how our eyes sense and detect light inputs and how the brain processes signals sent from the eyes."

Lesson,Elements of Crosscutting Concept(s),Rationale
1,Grades 3-5: A system can be described in terms of its components and their interactions.,"Lesson 1 builds on students’ ideas about systems and system models from elementary grades to prepare them for grade-level-appropriate use of this crosscutting concept in the unit. Days 1-3 engage students in systems thinking without labeling it as such. They use systems and system models for (1) developing initial models, (2) comparing the system in the video and the box model, and (3) asking and organizing questions on the DQB. After these experiences, students define and bound the system and reflect on the utility of systems thinking. For the most part, students use elements of systems thinking from 3rd-5th grade (i.e., “in terms of its components and their interactions”), but they build on their understanding of systems by articulating the boundary of the system in the video."
2,"Complex and microscopic structures and systems can be visualized, modeled, and used to describe how their function depends on the shapes, 
composition, and relationships among its parts; therefore, complex natural and designed 
structures/systems can be analyzed to determine how they function.","On day 1, students ask questions about how they could change the structure of the box model by changing the location of the light and make predictions about how the one-way mirror will function differently given the change. On day 2, students analyze how changing the light in the box model (structure) changed the function of the one way mirror. They model these changes to show the relationships among the light, the one-way mirror, and what we see."
3,"Structures can be designed to serve particular functions by taking into account properties of different materials, and how materials can be shaped and used.",Students make close observations and collect and analyze data while investigating how light interacts with three different materials. They notice similarities and differences in the way the materials transmit and reflect light. This helps students figure out that the properties of the materials (structure) play a role (function) in how much light reflects and transmits through each material.
4,"Complex and microscopic structures and systems can be visualized, modeled, and used to describe how their function depends on the shapes, 
composition, and relationships among its parts; therefore, complex natural and designed 
structures/systems can be analyzed to determine how they function.","Students consider the microscale structures of a one-way mirror, a regular mirror, and glass. They develop and use models to describe what happens to light when it shines on different structures in these materials (i.e., silver coating structures versus transparent glass structures versus dust or other impurities in glass)."
5,"Models can be used to represent systems and their interactions—such as inputs, processes andoutputs— and energy, matter, and information flows within systems.","Students use a model to represent how light interacts with the student, the adults, and the one way mirror within the two-room system when Room A is lit and Room B is dark."
6,Systems may interact with other systems; they may have sub-systems and be a part of larger complex systems.,Students consider how the light reflecting on an object in the system becomes an input of light into the eye. They identify the eye and brain as a new system.
6,"Models can be used to represent systems and their interactions—such as inputs, processes andoutputs— and energy, matter, and information flows within systems.","Students are challenged to represent the 
components of the eye system and explain how these components, along with the brain, interact with light inputs to determine what we “see.” Students apply this model to the one-way mirror phenomenon to determine why the student cannot see the adults."

6,"Complex and microscopic structures and systems can be visualized, modeled, and used to describe how their function depends on the shapes, 
composition, and relationships among its parts; therefore, complex natural and designed 
structures/systems can be analyzed to determine how they function.","Students explore the interactions between the complex structures of the eye and inputs of light. They investigate how the shape and composition of the eye’s lens causes light inputs to refract to focus light onto the retina at the back of the eye. They develop a path of light model to describe 
interactions between light inputs and the structure of the eye to explain how the eye focuses incoming light on the retina and transforms light inputs into signals that are sent to the brain."
7,Cause and effect relationships may be used to predict phenomena in natural or designed systems.,"Students use their understanding of cause and effect relationships to explain the one-way mirror phenomenon in the designed system in which it occurs. Specifically, they use their understanding of how the half-silvered structure of the one-way mirror causes about the same amount of light to transmit through and reflect off the one-way mirror. They also use their understanding about how the structure of the eye, nerves, and brain causes the brain to respond to strong light inputs. These causes result in the observed one-way mirror phenomenon. While this specific element calls out using cause and effect relationships to make predictions about a phenomenon, using those cause and effect relationships to explain a phenomenon is equally important in the 6-8th grade space."
7,"Models can be used to represent systems and their interactions—such as inputs, processes andoutputs— and energy, matter, and information flows within systems.","Students use system models developed in Lessons 5 and 6 to explain how the one-way mirror 
phenomenon works. Specifically, they consider the parts of the systems and the interactions or processes that happen between the parts as light moves within the system."
8,Systems may interact with other systems; they may have sub-systems and be a part of larger complex systems.,"On day 1 and 2, as students consider related phenomena they articulate the new systems in which these phenomena occur, focusing particularly on the boundaries of the systems. They articulate that when we change interactions within the system (by changing the light or changing the material) we change the light reflecting off objects (outputs) and into our eyes (inputs). Tracing light reflecting off objects and into the eye is an interaction between systems. Students reflect on what they know about systems to define systems on their Word Wall as a word we earn. If your students have more experience with systems thinking, you can add to this definition to include inputs and outputs within and between systems. However, students if this unit is used at the start of 6th grade, your students may have just started talking about inputs and outputs so they may not be ready to fully articulate that aspect of system thinking for the Word Wall."

8,"Complex and microscopic structures and systems can be visualized, modeled, and used to describe how their function depends on the shapes, 
composition, and relationships among its parts; therefore, complex natural and designed 
structures/systems can be analyzed to determine how they function.","At the end of day 1 and throughout day 2, students focus on how glass can function like a one-way mirror even though the structure of glass is different from one-way mirrors, at both macro and 
microscales. Students demonstrate that they understand a material can transmit and reflect different amounts of light, and if the light conditions on both sides of glass are just right, more or less reflection or transmission of light can happen even if the material’s structure does not change. They draw conclusions that a material can effectively function in different ways depending on the material’s interaction (or relationship) with other components of the system, which in this case is light."
