6,"Phenomena may have more than one cause, and some cause and effect relationships in systems can only be described using probability.","Students understand that phenomena may have more than one cause when they consider Question 5 in [material: TH.L6.ASMT], which problematizes how an airtight system can still undergo a temperature change even if it is exchanging no matter with the outside (which was one cause students have already identified as contributing to temperature changes)."

12,Patterns can be used to identify cause and effect relationships.,"The online simulation uses different shades of color and/or varying lengths of trails to indicate the speed (amount of kinetic energy) of individual particles of a gas. As students observe particle motion in the simulation, they look for recurring patterns in the changes that occur as the particles collide. These collisions result in transfers of energy between particles, which manifest as changes in color and/or trail length.
