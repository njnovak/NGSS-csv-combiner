To run this script, follow the instructions in instructions.txt

General debugging and common issues:

1. If the output looks incorrect, please refer to the included EXAMPLE_csv_FILE.txt to see what the csv files should look like.

    a. Additionally, an incorrect output may be due to an incorrect reference file, please see the format shown in EXAMPLE_REFERENCE_FILE.txt

    b. An issue will also arise if the naming convention is incorrect. Plase be sure that the reference file is named:
    "MS Reference for elements of practices and CCCs.txt", and that the csv files follow the convention in instructions.txt

2. If errors appear during script execution, certain packages may need to be installed. This package requires the python csv and os packages,
which are both native to python installs. As such, these issues may mean you need to update your python installation.

3. If files are not recognized, please ensure that the names are corect, and then try executing the python script from an IDE,
such as IDLE (Integrated Development and Learing Environment), found at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html

4. The current distribution may be updated periodically on github, at the following address: https://github.com/njnovak/NGSS-csv-project

5. Finally, if an issue arises that is not resolved, feel free to contact the developers at either nnovak@mail.bradley.edu or at mnovakccl@gmail.com.
