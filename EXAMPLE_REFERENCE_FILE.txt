        Reference text from page 16 of Appendix G
        2.1

        Cause and effect relationships may be used to predict phenomena in natural or designed systems. 
        2.3
        Phenomena may have more than one cause, and some cause and effect relationships in systems

CCC 3. Scale, Proportion, and Quantity – In considering phenomena, it is critical to recognize what is relevant at different size, time, and energy scales, and to recognize
proportional relationships between different quantities as scales change.
        CCC.element-ID
        Reference text from page 15 of Appendix G
        3.1

different types of quantities provide information about the magnitude of properties and processes.
        3.4
        Scientific relationships can be represented through the use of algebraic expressions and
equations.
        3.5

        CCC.element-ID
        Reference text from page 16 of Appendix G
        4.1
        Systems may interact with other systems; they may have sub-systems and be a part of larger complex systems.
        4.2
        Models can be used to represent systems and their interactions—such as inputs, processes and
outputs—and energy, matter, and information flows within systems.
        4.3

CCC 5. Energy and Matter: Flows, Cycles, and Conservation – Tracking energy and matter flows, into, out of, and within systems helps one understand their system’s behavior
        CCC.element-ID
        Reference text from page 17 of Appendix G
        5.1
        Matter is conserved because atoms are conserved in physical and chemical processes.

        Within a natural or designed system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter. 
        5.3
        Energy may take different forms (e.g. energy in fields, thermal energy, energy of motion). 
        5.4

CCC 6. Structure and Function – The way an object is shaped or structured determines many of its properties and functions.
        CCC.element-ID
        Reference text from page 17 of Appendix G
        6.1
        Complex and microscopic structures and systems can be visualized, modeled, and used to describe how their function depends on the shapes, composition, and relationships among its parts; therefore, complex natural and designed structures/systems can be analyzed to determine how they function. 
        6.2
        Structures can be designed to serve particular functions by taking into account properties of different materials, and how materials elements can be shaped and used.

        Reference text from page 17 of Appendix G
        7.1
        Explanations of stability and change in natural or designed systems can be constructed by examining the changes over time and forces at different scales, including the atomic scale.  
        7.2
        Small changes in one part of a system might cause large changes in another part.  
        7.3
        Stability might be disturbed either by sudden events or gradual changes that accumulate over time.  
        7.4
        Systems in dynamic equilibrium are stable due to a balance of feedback mechanisms.
